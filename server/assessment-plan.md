### Model

_Nothing to do... the `SecurityClearance` model exists and appears to be good to go._

### [ ] Controller (#.# hours)

* `SecurityClearanceController`

_Refer to the `AgentController` class and use that as an example for the methods to add and implementation details to follow._

### [ ] Domain (#.# hours)

* `SecurityClearanceService`
* `SecurityClearanceServiceTest`

_Refer to the `AgentService` class and use that as an example for the methods to add and implementation details to follow._

> **Decide how you're going to not touch the database when testing... use mocking or test double.**

#### Domain Rules

* Security clearance name is required
* Name cannot be duplicated
    * Retrieve existing security clearances and check to see if the security clearance to add/update is in the list

#### Deleting

**Can the delete succeed?** We need to know if the security clearance is being referenced.

_One idea... get all of the data from the agency_agent table for the security clearance ID that you're about to delete..._

```sql
select * from agency_agent where security_clearance_id = 1;
```

_Another idea... get row count from the agency_agent table for the security clearance ID that you're about to delete..._

```sql
select count(*) from agency_agent where security_clearance_id = 1;
```

### [ ] Data (#.# hours)

* `SecurityClearanceMapper` (this class exists)
* `SecurityClearanceJdbcTemplateRepository` (this class exists but is incomplete)
* `SecurityClearanceRepository` (this interface exists but is incomplete)
* `SecurityClearanceJdbcTemplateRepositoryTest` (this test class exists but is incomplete)

_Refer to the `AgentJdbcTemplateRepository` class and use that as an example for the methods to add and implementation details to follow._

> **Important: To support testing, update the `set_known_good_state()` stored procedure as needed.**

## Aliases CRUD

### HTTP Requests

#### Fetch an Individual Agent with Aliases Attached

**Request**

```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/agent/2 HTTP/1.1
```

**Responses**

* Success: 200 OK

> **Review the code paths through the app for retrieving an agent... need to update to include aliases**

#### Add an Alias

**Request**

```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/alias HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "agentId": 1,
  "name": "Test"
}
```

**Responses**

* Success: 201 Created
* Failure (validation errors): 400 Bad Request

#### Update an Existing Alias

**Request**

```
PUT http://localhost:8080/api/alias/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "aliasId": 1,
  "agentId": 1,
  "name": "Test",
  "persona": "Something"
}
```

**Responses**

* Success: 204 No Content
* Failure (validation errors): 400 Bad Request
* Failure (route path ID and request body ID don't match): 409 Conflict

#### Delete an Alias

**Request**

```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/alias/1 HTTP/1.1
```

**Responses**

* Success: 204 No Content
* Failure (cannot be found): 404 Not Found

### [ ] Model (#.# hours)

* `Alias`

### [ ] Controller (#.# hours)

* `AliasController`

_Refer to the `AgentController` class and use that as an example for the methods to add and implementation details to follow._

### [ ] Domain (#.# hours)

* `AliasService`
* `AliasServiceTest`

_Refer to the `AgentService` class and use that as an example for the methods to add and implementation details to follow._

> **Decide how you're going to not touch the database when testing... use mocking or test double.**

#### Domain Rules

* Name is required
* Persona is not required unless a name is duplicated. The persona differentiates between duplicate names.
    * Retrieve existing aliases and check to see if the alias to add/update is in the list
    * If it's a duplicate, then require the persona.

### [ ] Data (#.# hours)

* `AliasMapper` (class)
* `AliasJdbcTemplateRepository` (class)
* `AliasRepository` (interface)
* `AliasJdbcTemplateRepositoryTest` (test class)

_Refer to the `AgentJdbcTemplateRepository` class and use that as an example for the methods to add and implementation details to follow._

> **To support testing, update the `set_known_good_state()` stored procedure as needed.**

## [ ] Global Error Handling (#.# hours)

* Determine the most precise exception for **data integrity** failures and handle it with a specific data integrity message.
* For all other exceptions, create a general "sorry, not sorry" response that doesn't share exception details.

_Refer back to the "Spring Profiles, Error Handling, and CORS" lesson in the LMS._

> **Research the most specific exception to handle data integrity errors**
